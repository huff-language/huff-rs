> `huff-rs` is a [Huff](https://github.com/huff-language) compiler built in rust.

## What is a Huff?

Huff is a low-level programming language designed for developing highly optimized smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Huff does not hide the inner workings of the EVM. Instead, Huff exposes its programming stack to the developer for manual manipulation.

Rather than having functions, Huff has macros - individual blocks of bytecode that can be rigorously tested and evaluated using the Huff runtime testing suite.

[Huff](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/huff) was originally developed by the Aztec Protocol team to write [Weierstrudel](https://github.com/aztecprotocol/weierstrudel). Weierstrudel is an on-chain elliptical curve arithmetic library that requires incredibly optimized code that neither [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.14/) nor [Yul](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/yul.html) could provide.

While EVM experts can use Huff to write highly-efficient smart contracts for use in production, it can also serve as a way for beginners to learn more about the EVM.

## Installation

_Something not working? Send a message in [discord](https://discord.huff.sh)._

First run the command below to get `huffup`, the Huff installer:

```bash
curl -L get.huff.sh | bash
```

To avoid redirecting the script directly into bash, download and run the [huffup installation script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huff-language/huff-rs/main/huffup/install).

To install the Huff compiler, simply run `huffup`.

If you have the old [huffc (TypeScript version)](https://github.com/huff-language/huffc) npm package installed globally, you can remove it with:

```bash
sudo yarn global remove huffc
```

To make sure you are running the rust version, you can run `huffc --version` and it should respond with `huff_cli <version>`. If it responds with `2.0.0` that means you are running the Typescript version.

```bash
$ huffc --version
huff_cli 0.3.2
```

**Alternatively**

Install from source by running:

```bash
git clone https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huff-language/huff-rs
cd huff-rs
cargo install --path ./huff_cli --bins --locked --force
```

OR

```bash
cargo install --git https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huff-language/huff-rs --locked huff_cli
```

## How Fast?

**Compilation Benchmarks**

| Compiler                         | Cold (No Cache) | Light Cache | Deep Cache | Full Cache |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| [huff-language/huff-rs][huff-rs] | XXXms           | XXXms       | XXXms      | XXXms      |
| [huff-language/huffc][huffc]     | XXXms           | XXXms       | XXXms      | XXXms      |

_Note: Compilation benchmarks were performed on [huff-examples erc20](https://github.com/huff-language/huff-examples/tree/main/erc20/contracts/ERC20.huff)._

## Architecture

![Huff Compiler Architecture](./assets/huffc.png)

## Modules

- [huff_core](./huff_core): The core module to huff-rs. Resolves source file paths, executes compilation, and exports artifacts.
- [huff_cli](./huff_cli): The command line interface for the Huff compiler.
- [huff_js](./huff_js): A wasm compatible interface to the Huff compiler for JavaScript bindings.
- [huff_lexer](./huff_lexer): Takes in the source of a `.huff` file and generates a vector of `Token`s.
- [huff_parser](./huff_parser): Crafts a `Contract` AST from the vector of `Token`s generated by [huff_lexer](./huff_lexer).
- [huff_codegen](./huff_codegen): EVM Bytecode generation module that accepts an AST generated by [huff_parser](./huff_parser).
- [huff_utils](./huff_utils): Various utilities and types used by all modules.
- [huffup](./huffup): Update or revert to a specific huff-rs branch with ease. (Forked from [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry))

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/huff-language/huff-rs/issues/new); it's that easy!

To run examples, make sure you update git submodules to pull down the [huff-examples](./huff-examples/) submodule by running `git submodule update`.

The branching convention used by [huff-rs](https://github.com/huff-language/huff-rs) is a `stage` branch that is meant to be merged off of and is periodically merged into `main`. So, when creating a feature, branch off of the `stage` branch and create a pr from your branch into the `stage` branch!

i.e:
![Branching Conventions](./assets/branching.png)

To pass github actions, please run:

```bash
cargo check --all
cargo test --all --all-features
cargo +nightly fmt -- --check
cargo +nightly clippy --all --all-features -- -D warnings
```

In order to fix any formatting issues, run:

```bash
cargo +nightly fmt --all
```

**Recommended PR Template**

Here is an example PR template - not strictly required, but will greatly improve the speed at which your PR is reviewed & merged!

```md
## Overview

<Provide a general overview of what your pr accomplishes, why, and how (including links)>

## Checklist

- [x] <Ex: Added a `new` method to the Huff Lexer [here](./huff_lexer/src/lib.rs#50)>
- [x] <Ex: Fully tested the `new` method [here](./huff_lexer/tests/new.rs)>
- [ ] <Ex: Wrote documentation for the `new` method [here](./huff_lexer/README.md#20)>
```

When the PR checklist isn't complete, it is **highly** recommended to make it a draft PR. NOTE: if your PR is not complete, it will likely be changed to a draft by one of the repository admins.

For breaking changes: make sure to edit the [excalidraw asset](https://excalidraw.com/#json=9YvTZp-rY9NOQnX9TC8Dz,sVM8vpgvQqGiXNXrBNshTg) and export the file to [./assets/huffc.excalidraw](./assets/huffc.excalidraw) along with an image to [./assets/huffc.png](./assets/huffc.png).
